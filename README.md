# Machine Learning Models for Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on implementing and comparing 5 different machine learning models for sentiment analysis. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using various algorithms: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Project Structure
Here is a breakdown of the project structure:

- [DecisionTreeModel.py](): This file contains the implementation of the Decision Tree model, which is used for sentiment analysis. 
- [NaiveBayesClassifier.py](): Here, you'll find the Naive Bayes classifier implementation, another model for sentiment analysis. 
- [KNNModel.py](): In this file, has a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, which is effective for sentiment classification. 
- [RandomForestModel.py](): The Random Forest model is implemented in this file, offering another approach to sentiment analysis. 
- [SVMModel.py](): Lastly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was implemented in this file, which is widely used for sentiment classification tasks.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- scikit-learn==0.24.2
